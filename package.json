  "description": "Gridlocked is a grid based survival shooter that draws heavy influence from the Megaman Battle Network series. The player is capable of moving the character one square at a time to any square on the grid. As time goes on some squares may randomly brick out to make movement harder. The player must maneuver around these obstacles and projectiles from enemies on an opposing grid. Players can shoot enemies on the other side to rack up a higher score and increase their chance of surviving longer.",
